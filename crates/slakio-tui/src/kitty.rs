//! Keyboard enhancement (kitty keyboard protocol) setup shared by the binary and tests.
//!
//! Only `DISAMBIGUATE_ESCAPE_CODES` is requested: it is enough to tell Ctrl+Enter from Enter
//! and Esc from Alt+key, while text keys keep arriving as plain UTF-8. That keeps Korean IME
//! commits working (with `REPORT_ALL_KEYS_AS_ESCAPE_CODES` text would arrive as key codes)
//! and means terminals do not send release/repeat events (the app filters them anyway).
